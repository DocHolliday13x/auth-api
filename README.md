### Setup

1. create repo
2. add starter code
3. add all of the configs
4. extract all files from `api-server` into the root of the repo
5. `npm i` in the root of the repo and make sure that all the packages from both package.json files are installed. Ran `npm i cors bcrypt base-64 jsonwebtoken` to install the missing packages
6. Insert `auth` folder from the `auth-server` into the new repo's `src` folder
7. confirm things work
8. models - we need ONE `models/index.js` file, so will import users from `auth/models` into `src/models`.
